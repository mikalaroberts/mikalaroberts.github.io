# Welcome to my home on the internet ðŸ™‚

If you are reading this, it means that you are one of the first to visit this site. Be mindful that this is in it's hatchling stage. I have ideas about how I can use this platform, but chances are it will evolve as I go and not even I know it's final form!

Purposes I've considered:
- Sharing my thinking on a topic or question (as it stands at that time). Both to clarify through writing, and invite feedback and collaborators.
- Summarising my reading to ensure I answer the question 'how does this inform my practice?'
- A place to publish protocols and methods as I develop them.
- A public diary/blog of sorts

Chances are you will find both finished and unfinished thoughts as you explore â€” that is intentional. I hope it this is constantly in flux. I will add things as I can, then update as they change.

Anyway, thank you for joining me on this adventure.
